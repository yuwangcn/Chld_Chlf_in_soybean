Input soybean canopy : 
V231_rep1.txt
(The file was converted from the file 'CM_V231_rep1_M_mean.txt' to meet the requirement of the FastTracer, column 1-9 in  'CM_V231_rep1_M_mean.txt' to  column 6-14 in 'V231_rep1.txt',  column 10 in 'CM_V231_rep1_M_mean.txt' to  column 1 in 'V231_rep1.txt')

Output light profile with different leaf transmittance and reflectance settings (Check the 'Sim.txt' for simulation details)
